# Star Wars API Spring Boot

## What's this project?

This is a RestAPI that consumes the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev) using spring boot component Feign and OpenAPI.

## How this works?

You just need to execute the application and acess OpenApi interface, then choose the method you would like to use (Get, Post, Put, Delete).
